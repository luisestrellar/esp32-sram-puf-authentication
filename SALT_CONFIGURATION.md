# PBKDF2 Salt Configuration

## What is the Salt?

The PBKDF2 salt is used in key derivation to provide domain separation - it ensures that keys generated by this system are unique to this application and can't be reused in other contexts.

## Default Salt

This project uses:
```
PBKDF2_SALT = "ESP32-SRAM-PUF-Auth-v1"
```

## When to Change the Salt

You should change the salt if:
- You are forking this project significantly
- You are deploying in production for a company
- You want isolation from other users of this repository
- You are integrating with existing key management systems
- You have specific security requirements

## How to Change the Salt

### 1. Choose Your Salt
Select any string (letters, numbers, symbols) of reasonable length (10-50 characters).

### 2. Update ESP32 Code
```cpp
// hardware/esp32_authenticate_simple.ino or config.h
#define PBKDF2_SALT "YourCustomSalt"
```

### 3. Update Python Scripts
```python
// tools/puf-challenge-generator/pufchallenge.py
PBKDF2_SALT = b"YourCustomSalt"

// tools/verification/verify_algorithm.py
PBKDF2_SALT = b"YourCustomSalt"
```

### 4. Regenerate Tokens
**Important:** Changing the salt invalidates all existing tokens. You must:
- Re-generate tokens with the new salt
- Update server configuration with new tokens
- Re-flash ESP32 with new salt

## Salt Consistency

The salt must be identical in:
- `hardware/esp32_authenticate_simple.ino` (or config.h)
- `tools/puf-challenge-generator/pufchallenge.py`
- `tools/verification/verify_algorithm.py`

The salt is case-sensitive and must match exactly across all files.
